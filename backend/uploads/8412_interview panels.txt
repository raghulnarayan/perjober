3. Tell me about a challenge or conflict you overcame at previous work?

During my internship at Techciti Technologies, we faced a challenge with API performance—response times were slow when processing a high volume of reviews, and the system began to lag with concurrent requests. This created frustration within the team since project deadlines were tight. I took the initiative to analyze the database queries and noticed that multiple unnecessary joins and large payloads were slowing the system down. I restructured the queries, reduced payload sizes, and optimized indexing strategies. These changes reduced API response times by 40% and allowed the system to handle 30% more concurrent requests without performance issues. This experience taught me the importance of staying calm under pressure, breaking down complex problems into smaller parts, and communicating solutions effectively to my team.
