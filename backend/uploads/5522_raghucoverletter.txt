Hiring Manager
[company name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Python Developer position at [Company Name]. With a Master’s in Computer Applications from Bangalore University and hands-on experience in backend development, API design, and data-driven projects, I am eager to contribute my skills in Python, Django, Flask, and SQL to your team.

During my internship at Techciti Technologies, I developed and optimized RESTful APIs capable of processing over 5,000 reviews per minute, reducing data processing time by 25% and improving response times by 40%. My work on fake review detection achieved 92% accuracy, showcasing my ability to apply analytical thinking and technical skills to solve real-world problems.

I further enhanced my data handling expertise through a Gen AI Job Simulation at Forage, where I extracted insights from financial reports using Python and pandas, created interactive data visualizations, and built a chatbot capable of addressing over 100 financial queries. These experiences strengthened my ability to combine backend development with data science principles to deliver meaningful, user-focused solutions.

Beyond my technical expertise, I bring strong collaboration, critical thinking, and time management skills. My academic and professional journey reflects a consistent commitment to learning and adapting—qualities I believe align well with the innovative environment at [Company Name].

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my skills to real-world challenges and contribute to building scalable, efficient, and impactful software solutions. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background can add value to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.

Sincerely,
Raghu Lakshmi Narayan
